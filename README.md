# Introduction 
This is an api testing framework which will help us integrate the api integration tests with unit tests. This template is based on :
  1. JEST framework
  2. Supertest :  api testing library
  3. allure reporter to display the execution results.

# Getting Started
Clone this repo and do

  npm install

# Build and Test

  npm run test :   will set the execution environment as 'test' (by default) and will then start the execution on all the tests.
  Once execution is done, run 'npm run allureResults' to display the execution report in browser.
